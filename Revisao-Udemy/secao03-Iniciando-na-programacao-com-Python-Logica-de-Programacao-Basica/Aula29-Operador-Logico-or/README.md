# Aula 29 - Operador Lógico "or":
A avaliação do curto circuito em python é o mesmo que o JavaScript.

Obs: My recommendation is the student learned a bit more about math's proof concept about basic set theory. One can found it to practice at a good any book about Real Analysis in it introductory chapter. I will list someone of them:

- Curso de Analise Real Volume 1, Elon Lages Lima.

- Curso de Analise Real, Cassio Neri e Marcos Cabral.

- Real Analysis, Foundations and Functions of One Variable, Vera T. Sos and Miklos Laczkovich.

- Introduction to Calculus and Classical Analysis, Fourth Edition, Omar Hijab.

- Mathematics for Computer Science, Eric Lehman, F Thomson Leighton and Albert R Meyer.
