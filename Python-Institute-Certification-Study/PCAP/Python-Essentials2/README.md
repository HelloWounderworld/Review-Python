# Python Essentials - Part 2 (Intermediate)
This course is the second in a 2-course series that will prepare you for the PCAP: Certified Associate Python Programmer certification exam at a Pearson VUE Test Center.

The course picks up where Python Essentials - Part 1 leaves off. Its main goal is to teach you the skills related to the more advanced aspects of Python programming, including modules, packages, exceptions, file processing, as well as with general coding techniques and object-oriented programming (OOP).

The course is recommended for aspiring developers who are interested in pursuing careers connected with Software Development, and Security, Networking, and the Internet of Things (IoT).

### You will learn
- Learn general coding techniques and best practices

- Learn to use object-oriented programming in Python

- Learn how to import and use Python modules

- Learn how to handle exceptions

- Learn how to process files

- Prepare for PCAP certification

### Pre-requisites:
#### Python Essentials - Part 1 (Basics)
This course is the first in a 2-course series that will prepare you for the PCEP - Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer and PCAP: Certified Associate in Python Programming certification exams.

The main goal of the course is to guide you from a state of complete programming illiteracy to a level of programming knowledge which allows you to design, write, debug, and run programs encoded in the Python language, and to understand the basic concepts of software development technology.

The course will prepare you for jobs and careers connected with widely understood software development, which includes not only creating the code itself as a junior developer, but also computer systems design and software testing.
